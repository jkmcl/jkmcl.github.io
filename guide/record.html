<p class="title">Record Stores</p>

<p>For some reason, major classical labels usually release their recordings in Hong Kong months ahead of the international release dates.  Also, many hard-to-find titles (in other countries) from these labels and reissues from their Japanese branches are available here.  Most of the larger record stores have sizeable classical sections despite higher prices, and the smaller ones have more competitive prices to compensate for their smaller selections.  Listed below are selected record stores in the region of interest to classical music listeners.  They should be easy to find even for those who visit Hong Kong for the first time.</p>

<p><b><a href="http://www.hongkongrecords.hk/">Hong Kong Records</a></b>
<li><i>Shop L2-01, Festival Walk, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon (Tel: 2265-8299)</i>
<li><i>Shop 252, Pacific Place, 88 Queensway, Hong Kong (Tel: 2845-7088)</i>
<li><i>Shop 3320, Gateway Arcade, Harbour City, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon (Tel: 2175-5700)</i>

<p>In its early (pre-HMV) days, Hong Kong Records was the largest record store in the region.  Now that all four branches of HMV have downsized their classical section, Hong Kong Records' branch at Festival Walk can be safely called the best store for classical listeners.  In addition to the size of the selection, staff members are friendly and knowledgeable.</p>

<p><b><a target="_top" href="http://www.shuncheongrec.com/">Shun Cheong Record</a></b>
<li><i>Room 801, Bank Centre, 636 Nathan Rd., Mongkok, Kowloon (Tel: 2332-2398)</i>

<p>The largest local distributor of independent labels such as Hyperion, Harmonia Mundi, Pearl, Tahra, Testament, BBC Legends, etc. has a showroom in Mongkok.  Many of the titles from these labels, which might be hard to find elsewhere, are available there.  Check out its web site before you go: it does not have long business hours and does not open on Sundays and public holidays.</p>

<p><b><a target="_top" href="http://www.hmv.com.hk">HMV</a></b>

<li><i>G - 1/F, HK Pacific Centre, 28 Hankow Road, Tsimshatsui, Kowloon (Tel: 2302-0122)</i>
<li><i>Suite 101, 1/F Central Building, 1-3 Pedder Street, Central, Hong Kong (Tel: 2739-0268)</i>
<li><i>Shop No. K3, 1/F Queensway Plaza, Admiralty, Hong Kong (Tel: 3692-4178)</i>
<li><i>1/F, Style House, The Park Lane, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong (Tel: 2504-3669)</i>
<li><i>Shop F5-7, 1/F, Telford Plaza I, Kowloon Bay, Kowloon (Tel: 2756 3068)</i>

<p>The international chain store HMV entered the Hong Kong market in the 1990s and established five branches in the busiest districts.  Unfortunately, all their classical sections have been downsized and the very high prices do not help to keep their customers.  The Queensway Plaza store can be ignored as the classical section is tiny.</p>

<p><b>United Records</b>
<li><i>Shop 26, G/F., Caroline Centre, 2-38 Yun Ping Rd., Causeway Bay, Hong Kong (Tel: 2577-8703)</i>

<p>Probably the oldest existing store that has a sizeable selection of classical CDs.  It is a good place to look for discontinued titles, especially those from the major labels.  Pricing is about the same as that of Hong Kong Records.</p>

-->

<p><b>Pro Sound</b>
<li><i>5/F, Yuen Kee International Building, 3 Queen Victoria Street, Central, Hong Kong (Tel: 2122-9369)</i>

<p>First opened in the Exchange Square, then moved to the Prince Building and later disappeared briefly, Pro Sound settled down at Hang Seng Building for many years.  In early 2008, it moved to the present location and was significantly downsized.  Although the size of its classical selection is not impressive, this store offers very competitive prices.</p>

<p><b>Percival Records</b>
<li><i>G/F, 35 Wing Kut Street, Sheung Wan, Hong Kong (Tel: 2541-0855)</i>

<p>Similar to Pro Sound, Percival is back in business, but at the original location, after many years.  New releases show up there earlier than in other stores and prices are among the lowest in the region.  It doesn't put that many discs on display and most people bring a shopping list there to order the discs they want.  It does have many hard-to-find box sets.</p>

<p><b>A &amp; B Sound</b>
<li><i>Shop 148-9, 1/F Maritime Square, Tsing Yi, New Territories (Tel: 2497-2332)</i>
<li><i>G01-03, Paradise Mall, Heng Fa Chuen, Hong Kong (Tel: 2897-1180)</i>
<li><i>Shop 162, East Point City, Tseung Kwan O (Tel: 2701-0284)</i>

<p><b>Disc Plus</b>
<li><i>Shop 2021, 2/F, IFC Mall, 8 Finance Street, Central, Hong Kong</i>

<p>Both A &amp; B Sound and Disc Plus offer very competitive prices despite their small selection. That said, they are good places to get new releases because of the low prices. They also have items that are sold out and not restocked at the large chain stores.</p>

<!--

<p><b>Win Win Shop</b>
<li><i>49 Tung Choi Street, Mong Kok, Kowloon (Tel: 2782-2819)</i>

<p><b>CD Warehouse</b>
<li><i>Shop B215, Basement II, Times Square, 1 Matheson Street, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong (Tel: 2506-0621)</i>
<li><i>Shop 257, City Plaza, 18 Taikoo Shing Road, Hong Kong (Tel: 3528-0992)</i>
<li><i>Shop B34-36, Treasure World, Site 11, Whompoa Garden, Hung Hom, Kowloon (Tel: 2180-8499)</i>
<li><i>Shop 249-250, Plaza Hollywood, 3 Lung Poon St. Diamond Hill, Kownloon (Tel: 3101-9066)</i>
<li><i>Shop 1, Level 1, Discovery Park Shopping Centre, 398 Castle Peak Rd., Tsuen Wan, New Territories (Tel: 2940-3733)</i>

-->

<!--

<p><b>Tower Records</b>
<li><i>Shop 701, Times Square, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong (Tel: 2506-0811)</i>

<p>Tower Records started their business in Hong Kong around the same time as HMV.  They opened two stores but one of them was closed already.  Unfortunately, the classical section at the remaining store is really small now.</p>
