<p class="title">Opera</p>

<p>There are usually two major local opera productions per year in Hong Kong.  One is staged during the Hong Kong Arts Festival as a major event.  Sometimes foreign opera companies are invited to stage their productions in the Festival instead.  Another annual opera production is funded by the Urban Council, and LO King-Man, the headmaster of the Hong Kong Academy of Performing Arts, has been the main driving force behind these annual productions.  The Academy also has its own opera productions which serve as the training ground for its many students.  Recently the Regional Council has staged its first production, too.</p>

<p><b><a target="_top" href="http://www.opera.org.hk/">The Opera Society of Hong Kong</a></b></p>

<p>The Opera Society of Hong Kong was founded by a group of dedicated and mostly amateur singers. It aims to promote opera and musical theatre to the people of Hong Kong.  Since 1992, the chorus of the Society has performed in many local opera productions as well has orchestral concerts with the Hong Kong Philharmonic and other orchestras.  The chairman and the chorusmaster of the society is Raymond Fu.</p>
